      <h1 class="display-3">Timothy Heejai Chang</h1>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Tim and I am a data engineer and at times a software engineer and data scientist. This is my first attempt to create a personal website using Ruby on Rails. I am not a front-end developer but my current company uses Ruby on Rails so I decided to try my hand at making an application for myself. Why? Um why not? </p>
      <p>This website presents some of my work, personal projects, previous experiences and blog posts. I've set it up so only I can sign in for now. I don't see a point in allowing users to create their own account just yet. I am an eternal student, I will never stop learning and I will never give up.</p>
      <p>Technical Skills: Database Admin   Data Modeling   Data Analysis</p>
      <p>Tech Used: Python  Java  SQL (MSSQL,mySQL, Postgres,)</p>
      <p>Industries: Finance    Supply Chain Logistics    Government    Healthcare    Credit Loan</p>

      <p>What I am looking: My dream company is working for a Content like Netflix, Youtube or SNAP. </p>
